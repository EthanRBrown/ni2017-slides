const q1copy = `Arrow functions are a little more than just syntactic sugar; yes, they make function declaration
a little more compact, but they also have some functional differences.  Most importantly, they
bind the "this" variable lexcially instead the context-dependent rules for regular functions or
methods.  To learn more, I recommend <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-es6-the-dope-way-part-ii-arrow-functions-and-the-this-keyword-381ac7a32881">Mariya Diminsky's article</a>
on the subject and, of coruse, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">MDN's documentation</a>.  The answer to the question in my presentation is: 1) if the body of the arrow function isn't a block statement (denoted by curly braces), the body must be an expression (which resolves to a value), and there is an implicit <code>return</code> statement (and it's a syntax error to provide a return statement in this case); 2) <code>this</code> is bound lexically (i.e. it takes on the value of <code>this</code> where the arrow function was declared, not determined at execution time like a normal function; and 3) the <code>arguments</code> variable isn't available like it is in a regular function (you can use argument rest parameters to get all arguments).`
const q2copy = `The <i>spread operator</i> provides a way to treat arrays as if they were individual values separated by commas (hence the
name: you are "spreading" the array values out with commas).  I recommend the David Walsh article,
<a href="https://davidwalsh.name/spread-operator">6 Great Uses of the Spread Operator</a>, and the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator">MDN documentation</a>.`
